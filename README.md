# MelNet

#### Unofficial implementation of the paper "MelNet: A Generative Model for Audio in the Frequency Domain"

> deep-learning sequence-modeling deep-generative-modeling  seq2seq  tensorflow

Audio representation in the frequency domain is more concise, which makes MelNet able to model longer-range
dependencies than existing time-domain models.
By modeling raw sound in form of a spectrograms, the output, be it speech or music, sounds more organic, as opposed to modeling sheet music in form of notes.
